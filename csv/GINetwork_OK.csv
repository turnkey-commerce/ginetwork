"Cornerstone Assistance Network of Oklahoma, Inc.",scott@cornerstoneokc.org,Scott Manley,,Executive Director,,PO Box 20629 ,Oklahoma City,73156,,"Connecting people in need with Christians who care.Purpose and MissionFrom inception, Cornerstone has sought to enable the Church to take a more active role in liberating people from both physical and spiritual poverty. We believe this is accomplished by connecting people in need with Christians who care. So, we continue to work and believe that the Church can become effective in creating long-term change in the lives of the needy people through relationships of accountability that lead to new or deeper relationships with God and the Christian community.OpportunityWelfare reform offers an historic opportunity for the Church to reverse more than three decades of detachment from the poor. With the government's admitted failure to ""be all things to all people"" the burden must shift. However, the Church now finds itself unequipped to respond to the ""least of these"" with practical help. New ways must be found to effectively channel the compassion of the Church toward the needs of our city. The season is right for finding these new ways.ChallengesTo motivate the Church to become more active in liberating people from both physical and spiritual poverty.To mobilize and train church members to show practical care for those in need.To facilitate partnerships with churches, government, and businesses in distressed communities for the purpose of nurturing lives and restoring character.

The number is increasing as a result of the AIDS epidemic, which has killed many parents, leaving children abandoned in the streets as orphans.C.R.O.is a non-profit organization comprising of volunteers led by the Project Manager, Mr. Michael Nieswand who has been helping street children since 1984.Once a child joins the street life for whatever reason, within a short period of time the character and behaviour changes very dramatically. On the streets the child meets other children who are organized in gangs and the newcomer will be forced to join such a group for his own security. Our research has shown that only a few children are able to survive on the streets alone. 95% join gangs,and get involved in drug addiction, theft, crime and immoral sexual behaviour.   Our basic approach in moulding the characters of children has been the gospel of JESUS CHIRIST. Christian values like love, forgiveness, humility, kindness and honesty have greatly improved the behaviour and life of the street children. In many cases prayer also redused their problems. We have practicaly experienced GOD's power and help in our ministry in many ways. Many of the former Street Children have come to CHRIST and the crusade outreach team, composed of 60 former street children who are now evangelizing to others.

"Parent Child Center of Tulsa, Inc.",nmoore@parentchildcenter.org,Nancy Moore,,Development Director,www.parentchildcenter.org,1421 S Boston ,Tulsa,74119,,"The work of The Parent Child Center has been ongoing since 1972. The current agency was officially incorporated on May 1, 1990, with the merger of two smaller United Way agencies: At Risk Parent Child Program and Child Abuse Prevention Services. The At Risk Parent Child Program began in 1974 at Hillcrest Medical Center when medical personnel noticed that some babies born there a few months earlier returned to the emergency room abused, neglected or failing to thrive. Dr. Donald Pfeiffer established one of the nation''s first SCAN teams to screen families of newborns for risk of abuse and neglect, and designed a home visitation program to offer parenting education. This program became the Prevention component of The Parent Child Center. In 1972, wives of physicians at St. Francis Hospital were hearing about the same types of sad situations. They founded a Tulsa chapter of Parents Anonymous, a self-help group for parents. In May 1981, this organization was granted 501(c)(3) status. In 1984, the organization received United Way funding and moved toward more comprehensive services and was renamed Child Abuse Prevention Services (CAPS) in 1987. This program formed the basis for the Treatment component of The Parent Child Center. To better serve clients by offering related services within a single agency, the Boards of Directors of At Risk and CAPS worked for two years, at the urging of United Way, toward a merger which became final in 1990. In 1997, The Parent Child Center completed a $3.2 million capital/endowment drive and moved into its own home at 1421 South Boston. While The Parent Child Center has had a significant impact on the lives of thousands of children and families over the years, there is still a critical need for child abuse prevention and treatment services in Oklahoma. The latest statistics available from the Oklahoma Department of Human Services for 2005 were released in September 2006. The report shows a total of 6,095 investigations and 1,209 confirmed cases of child abuse and/or neglect in Tulsa County, raising the number of confirmed cases by 78. The state of Oklahoma figures report 61,926 investigations with 13,328 cases confirmed; raising the number of investigations by 1,156 and the number of confirmed cases by 981. There were 42 deaths in Oklahoma in 2005 as a result of child abuse and/or neglect. Twelve deaths were in Tulsa County. This is two times the number of deaths in Tulsa County than the previous year?s deaths. Research points out that those who have been childhood victims of abuse and neglect often perpetuate these behaviors as adults (Oklahoma KIDS COUNT Factbook 2004). Adverse childhood experiences, such as child abuse, domestic violence, divorce and drug abuse, to name a few, evolve into risky behaviors and, ultimately, into disease and death (The Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) Study 2007). The risk factors for infants and young children to become victims of child abuse and neglect include low income and poverty, teen mothers, absent fathers, short birth spacing, parents with less than a 12th grade education and lack of positive emotional, physical and intellectual experiences (Community Service Council of Greater Tulsa ? Community Profile 2007). The more risk factors present, the greater the likelihood of child abuse and neglect occurring. Research also shows the earlier a family at risk for abuse and neglect receives vital information, training and support, the greater the opportunity for them to be or become effective, protecting and nurturing parents. Early intervention strengthens families and reduces costs of medical treatment and emotional trauma (ACE Study 2007) while also reducing future direct and indirect costs to society such as incarceration, foster care and juvenile delinquency. Parenting education and support is the key to preventing child abuse and neglect.

Intervention Program - ADULT AND CHILDREN TREATMENT PROGRAMS Intake/Assessments: Conducted with every family member to determine needs for services and to develop appropriate treatement plans. Counseling/Therapy: Individual, child and family counseling and therapy services are by a Ph.D. and master's level therapists to clients for issues involving current or past abuse and/or neglect, parenting issues and relationship problems having an impact on children.",0.0,0.0,73-1113167,OK
