The foundation has responded to this mission in various ways:        Investigating Religious Fraud     Sometimein the 1980s, America''s religious complexion shifted toward a""prosperity gospel."" By virtue of Trinity''s interest in religiouscommunication ministries, we were in the right spot to confront theexcesses and self-absorption we saw.      Social Ministry     From itsinception Trinity members have taken the needy into their homes and fedthe hungry. In the late 1980s, we started a program called The DallasProject to encourage other congregations to do the same. In recentyears we''ve provided a vehicle for similar ministries in apartmentcomplexes in Oklahoma and Ohio. Currently we are endeavoring to beginseminars to help churches and non-profits get involved in affordablehousing.      Sanctuary in the City     A singleBible study begun by Ole Anthony in 1975 grew to include a community ofseveral dozen Christian believers in a transitional area of EastDallas, as well as independent groups meeting in North Carolina,Minnesota, Florida, New York City and elsewhere. The Dallas communityorganized in 2010 as a church congregation, separate from TrinityFoundation, called Community on Columbia (The Block). Study focuses onthe ancient Jewish roots of the faith and how the gospel of the Crossof Christ relates to personal discipleship.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

The missionaries then use their resources for education, especially the children. This combination has proven to be very successful in combating continual poverty. Everyone who works for or with Sky Cross does not receive a salary or monetary gift, so that 100% of all donations are spent directly for food and medical supplies, unless a donor requests otherwise. All expenses are paid by Sky Cross volunteers.

Sky Cross, Inc. provides non perishable food and some medical supplies to the poor in 43 locations, 41 in Mexico, along the Texas-Mexico border. The food and medical supplies benefit a total of approximately 30,000 poor in these locations. The supplies are distributed by 24 established missionaries serving these poor. The foodstuff and medical supplies provided by Sky Cross enable the missionaries to use their resources for the education of the children.",0.0,0.0,74-2735853,TX

When they are going through the process of divorce, parents are under so much stress that they spend less time with their children and are less attentive to children's needs. The seminar is designed to make them aware of children's perceptions of this momentous event in their lives and teach them what they can do to help guide them through what they describe as ""the heartbreak of a lifetime."" Most parents who attend are ordered to do so by the courts. Others are referred by attorneys or counselors who are familiar with the program. This program addresses potential child abuse by parents who overlook children's needs during and after divorce, and often use children as pawns to hurt each other.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Box 721615 Greater Houston Chapter 63,Houston,77272,,"Parents Without Partners provides single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship and the exchange of parenting techniques. Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Historically with substance abuse recovery, people who were in recovery felt the need to stay with one another to offer support, stay sober, and continue working on their program. Halfway houses had been the ?patient's? way of doing aftercare, which had never been a part of treatment. Halfway houses generally were not an entrepreneurial enterprise but a means for persons with a common desire for sobriety to support one another. Sometimes an individual simply owned a home and opened it up to others with whom they had been in recovery, and it could be a landlord-tenant relationship.  In the past there have been concerns from neighborhoods who have seen strangers in their area, more traffic in and out of the houses and a general feeling of uncertainty.

During 2008, we served approximately 100 clients. We provide temporary housing and rehabilitative services for alcohol and drug addicts offering them a safe environment while working with other addicts on changing their life styles to one of sobriety.",0.0,0.0,20-2171318,TX

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country.  Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Box 3612 Tumbleweeds Chapter 258,El Paso,79923,,"Parents Without Partners provides single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship and the exchange of parenting techniques. Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Today CAM is supported by 68 member churches as well as several other supporting churches in the San Antonio area.   Serving as an extension of its Member Churches, CAM   s mission is to share the love of Christ by providing immediate assistance and encouragement to people in crisis situations, facing chronic poverty, mental and physical illness, homelessness or recent job loss.  CAM provides basic needs and then refers individuals to social service programs that provide long term support. For many of its clients, Christian Assistance Ministry is a bridge to support from other agencies or government services, providing food and financial aid until another agency can take over assistance. CAM''s services are sustained by an active volunteer force of over 150 individuals from Member Churches, the Board of Directors and the community at large, who run the food and clothing pantries and interview clients on a daily basis.

During 2009, Christian Assistance Ministries assisted over 39,000 needy individuals with food, clothing, school supplies, rent assistance, and utilitiy assistance.",29.4282943,-98.4826339,74-1947967,TX

We believe that children and adults receiving food aid deserve a nutritious mix of foods; thus we strive to provide foods ranging from fresh produce and dairy products through frozen meats to packaged pasta and bottled juices.  With the mission to eliminate hunger, we seek to educate recipients about nutrition so they may reap the greatest possible benefit from the donated food.  We also work to reach all pockets of hunger in our area by serving a large range of charities including pantries, soup kitchens, Kids Cafes, senior centers, low-income daycare centers, emergency shelters, disaster-relief organizations and other social service centers.

What we do for our youth and adults is more important than what we do to them.  paxUnited ''s programs provide youth and the adults in their environment with the life skills they need for peaceful conflict resolution.   Peers Making Peace     is an innovative peer-mediation program that uses a preventive approach  for handling conflicts both in and out of school. The program''s goal is  to improve school environments by reducing violence, assaults, and  discipline referrals, and to consequently improve overall academic  performance. This is accomplished by training teams of students to act  as peer mediators on their school campuses. The benefits achieved through our peer mediation process are remarkable:          Participation is totally voluntary.               The needs of all parties are expressed in a non-threatening, familiar environment.               Every participant is allowed equal time to present their understanding of the disputed issues.               Emotions are expressed and anger is diffused.               Conflicts are resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.               Everyone''s needs are met, no one is hurt, and relationships are improved.          To date,  paxUnited   has been directly responsible for establishing over 5,000 programs in  28 states, impacting the lives of over 3 million children.

Military Child Education Coalition,Mary.Keller@MilitaryChild.org,Mary Keller,,Executive Director,www.MilitaryChild.org,909 Mountain Lion Circle ,Harker Heights,76548,,"  Military children move an average of six to nine times during their K-12 school years. Many make multiple moves during high school alone.   Academic courses, extracurricular programs, graduation requirements and transfer of records vary greatly from state to state and even from school to school. These frustrations, in addition to giving up friends and associates, cause anxiety in military children. Separation from a deployed parent (or parents) tends to exacerbate an already difficult situation.    The Military Child Education Coalition is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit , worldwide organization that identifies the challenges facing the highly mobile military child; increases awareness of these challenges in military and educational communities; and initiates and implements programs to overcome them. MCEC''s goal is to level the educational playing field for military children wherever they are located around the world, and to model programs that are beneficial to all highly mobile children.

YMCA of Corpus Christi,jscoville@ymca-cc.org,James Scoville,,Executive Director,http://www.ymca-cc.org,417 S Upper Broadway ,Corpus Christi,78401,,"Founded in 1883, YMCAs collectively make up the largest nonprofit community service organization in America. YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs'' strength is in the people they bring together.In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation''s largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men''s Christian Association.The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn''t until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.

Dr. Glenn Wilkerson, with the support of the University of Texas, performed a study in Houston elementary, middle and high schools. Students at all levels of performance revealed a child''s self-concept is made of 2/3''s self-esteem and 1/3 self worth.   It further revealed a child''s self esteem is fueled by the unconditional love and acceptance given by the adults in their life. Self worth was fueled by what they could achieve. This study resulted in developing a program that didn''t exist until now, the ARK Program. (Adults Relating to Kids)  ARK reaches children through the adults in their lives. It teaches parents, schoolteachers, childcare workers and other caregivers how to relate to children with unconditional love and acceptance. It creates relationships that allow us to deal with all situations, good and bad, by separating the child from the behavior. Loving them for who they are, not what they do. This program helps us raise children into responsible, loving adults giving them hope and confidence in a better tomorrow. This program also benefits adult relationships.

Aerospace Education America''s love of manned flight started with the Wright brothers and continues unabated during this century. World War II showcased the important role aviation would play in the future and national leaders recognized the importance of stimulating public interest in aerospace activities. CAP, as the civilian Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, was most suited to perform this mission. Their efforts focused on two different audiences - internal CAP members and the general public.Aerospace educators working out of CAP''s National Headquarters at Maxwell AFB, Ala., provide materials that are current and reflect the highest standards of educational excellence.The congressional charter also tasked CAP to stimulate public interest in aerospace issues. These external programs are primarily conducted through our nation''s education systems.  These workshops highlight basic aerospace knowledge and focus on advances in aerospace technology. Textbooks, learning tools, and visual aids geared to stimulate interest in aerospace matters also are provided for teachers to use in their classrooms. Started in 1951, these workshops have reached hundreds of thousands of young people.CAP also plans and executes the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education. NCASE is the premier aerospace education conference held in the nation. The NCASE is designed to promote an understanding of aviation and space education to motivate and encourage teachers to incorporate aerospace education into their curriculum. It also encourages aerospace leaders to speak out on aerospace issues facing our nation today.

HABITAT FOR HUMANITYThis international program, initiated in 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller, helps end poverty and provide affordable homes for low-income families.  In 1999, CSF partnered with the Habitat chapters in North Texas to provide the air conditioning and heating systems in these homes.  Each year CSF provides equipment and labor for installation of 30 systems in new homes.SHORT-TERM COMMUNITY PROJECTSThese projects are an avenue through which volunteers respond to emerging community needs through non-profit organizations that provide services to people in crisis and rehabilitation programs.  Through funds provided by the CSF, precious dollars can then be used to provide direct services to people in crisis and rehabilitation programs.

"Mentors for Veterans by Veterans, Inc.",jimw@mentorsforveterans.org,James Wright,,President,www.mentorsforveterans.org,PO Box 3205 ,Odessa,79760,,"We are a faith-based nonprofit mentoring organization that is run for Veterans by Veterans! Our objective is to give Veterans, especially those that are disabled, a realistic hope of achieving the meaningful and enriched future that they deserve after they leave the military. We are meeting this objective by using a nationwide array of both Campus and Online programs to assist Veterans in transforming their hopes and dreams into specific workable plans. Since Vietnam, sociologists and psychologists have spent a considerable amount of time evaluating the root causes of problems that Veterans have when they leave the military. Our methods to help these Veterans help themselves are based on the results of their studies.The primary reason that many Veterans have such a difficult time adjusting to civilian life, and for example utilizing the GI Bill for education, after leaving the military is that as new civilians they often feel ""alone and lost."" This is because while in the military they were ""programmed to act as a member of an efficient team that had well-defined missions where their individual responsibilities were very specific."" Their loyalty and obedience were rewarded by the military supplying all of their basic life needs (food, shelter, medical care, etc.) and they knew the other members of their team would not let them down. In fact, the team members often risked their lives for each other. The end result of this military training, or programming, is that the team members became strongly bonded to each other through the team. This type of team is often called an ""emotional support group"" by sociologists and psychologists. We help colleges and universities throughout the America set up ""Veteran self-mentoring"" programs on their campuses where Veterans help each other academically, emotionally and spiritually. This self-mentoring program is actually the basis of forming a ""new emotional support group"" that replaces the strong one that they had while in the military. These on-campus programs are created as ""student activities"" organizations in order to retain the character and personality of each particular campus. We work with the Veteran ""Certifying Official"" on each campus in the forming of this organization in a manner that it will be the basis of this new support group for the Veterans. Our activities include 1) helping find a suitable faculty advisor, 2) helping the faculty advisor set up a ""student activities"" organization, 3) suggesting activities that have worked for Veterans in the past on other campuses, and 4) creating a ""national lessons learned"" report so the organizations on each campus nationwide will improve from semester to semester. The basis of all of our programs is to assist, guide and support the Veterans through the academic or technical training required to meet their individual aspirations. Finally, we help prepare them to successfully participate in a competitive job market. As an integral and fundamental part of this process we persistently point Veterans down the path of good habits, good morals, good health, and good friends to help them continue to develop their new civilian emotional support system to replace the one they left behind in the military. To the best of our knowledge, no other assistive group or organization provides these services for the Veteran.
