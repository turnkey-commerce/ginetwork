The foundation has responded to this mission in various ways:        Investigating Religious Fraud     Sometimein the 1980s, America''s religious complexion shifted toward a""prosperity gospel."" By virtue of Trinity''s interest in religiouscommunication ministries, we were in the right spot to confront theexcesses and self-absorption we saw.      Social Ministry     From itsinception Trinity members have taken the needy into their homes and fedthe hungry. In the late 1980s, we started a program called The DallasProject to encourage other congregations to do the same. In recentyears we''ve provided a vehicle for similar ministries in apartmentcomplexes in Oklahoma and Ohio. Currently we are endeavoring to beginseminars to help churches and non-profits get involved in affordablehousing.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

When they are going through the process of divorce, parents are under so much stress that they spend less time with their children and are less attentive to children's needs. The seminar is designed to make them aware of children's perceptions of this momentous event in their lives and teach them what they can do to help guide them through what they describe as ""the heartbreak of a lifetime."" Most parents who attend are ordered to do so by the courts. Others are referred by attorneys or counselors who are familiar with the program. This program addresses potential child abuse by parents who overlook children's needs during and after divorce, and often use children as pawns to hurt each other.

Box 3471 San Angelo Chapter 279,San Angelo,76902,,"Parents Without Partners provides single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship and the exchange of parenting techniques. Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Stacey found ways to help others by researching the questions that were unanswered. She provided support through networking with other patients, like herself.

About 90% of those we serve, live on a small fixed income that does not stretch to cover housing, medical needs and enough food for an entire month.  As a result, many seniors and adults with disabilities, suffer from the effects of poor nutrition.  Poor nutrition is one of the chief causes of premature institutional placement in hospitals and nursing homes.  A large number of those served by Meals on Wheels Plus have few visitors other than the volunteer who delivers their noon meal.  Many of them feel alienated and may develop emotional and/or mental disorders as a result of this isolation and deprivation.  Besides delivering a nutritious meal, including special diets,the volunteers report unmet needs discovered and often form friendships with those they serve.

Box 5452 Alamo Chapter 309,San Antonio,78201,,"Parents Without Partners provides single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship and the exchange of parenting techniques. Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Historically with substance abuse recovery, people who were in recovery felt the need to stay with one another to offer support, stay sober, and continue working on their program. Halfway houses had been the ?patient's? way of doing aftercare, which had never been a part of treatment. Halfway houses generally were not an entrepreneurial enterprise but a means for persons with a common desire for sobriety to support one another. Sometimes an individual simply owned a home and opened it up to others with whom they had been in recovery, and it could be a landlord-tenant relationship.  In the past there have been concerns from neighborhoods who have seen strangers in their area, more traffic in and out of the houses and a general feeling of uncertainty.

During 2008, we served approximately 100 clients. We provide temporary housing and rehabilitative services for alcohol and drug addicts offering them a safe environment while working with other addicts on changing their life styles to one of sobriety.",0.0,0.0,20-2171318,TX

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country.  Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Box 3612 Tumbleweeds Chapter 258,El Paso,79923,,"Parents Without Partners provides single parents and their children with an opportunity for enhancing personal growth, self-confidence and sensitivity towards others by offering an environment for support, friendship and the exchange of parenting techniques. Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Certain agencies, for example may not be able to assist a person if  the person does not complete the proper forms. Setting an appointment  with one agency may be useless if a person has not visited another one  first.   New2Need has learned now to move through the system and provides:    Up-to-date contact information for agencies appropriate to the person.  Information on estimated wait times.  Research on the required information necessary to file with these agencies.   New2Need   s hotline operates throughout the day and evening as needed.  From callers, the organization gains the information necessary to  propose the most effective solutions for their situations. Utilizing  their sources, New2Need researches, develops and proposes the most  appropriate steps for clients to take to achieve their desired outcomes.  Unlike other local charities, New2Need does not offer food, clothing  or financial assistance. They work to understand their clients      unique  needs so New2Need can direct them on the right course. The  organization   s main concern is that the people they help have the  resources to receive the assistance they need while maintaining their  dignity and self-respect. New2Need knows the challenges faced can be  daunting, but they also know that there are people and agencies that can  lend a helping hand.

For many of its clients, Christian Assistance Ministry is a bridge to support from other agencies or government services, providing food and financial aid until another agency can take over assistance.

With the mission to eliminate hunger, we seek to educate recipients about nutrition so they may reap the greatest possible benefit from the donated food.  We also work to reach all pockets of hunger in our area by serving a large range of charities including pantries, soup kitchens, Kids Cafes, senior centers, low-income daycare centers, emergency shelters, disaster-relief organizations and other social service centers.

What we do for our youth and adults is more important than what we do to them.  paxUnited ''s programs provide youth and the adults in their environment with the life skills they need for peaceful conflict resolution.   Peers Making Peace     is an innovative peer-mediation program that uses a preventive approach  for handling conflicts both in and out of school. The program''s goal is  to improve school environments by reducing violence, assaults, and  discipline referrals, and to consequently improve overall academic  performance. This is accomplished by training teams of students to act  as peer mediators on their school campuses. The benefits achieved through our peer mediation process are remarkable:          Participation is totally voluntary.               The needs of all parties are expressed in a non-threatening, familiar environment.               Every participant is allowed equal time to present their understanding of the disputed issues.               Emotions are expressed and anger is diffused.               Conflicts are resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.               Everyone''s needs are met, no one is hurt, and relationships are improved.          To date,  paxUnited   has been directly responsible for establishing over 5,000 programs in  28 states, impacting the lives of over 3 million children.

Military Child Education Coalition,Mary.Keller@MilitaryChild.org,Mary Keller,,Executive Director,www.MilitaryChild.org,909 Mountain Lion Circle ,Harker Heights,76548,,"  Military children move an average of six to nine times during their K-12 school years. Many make multiple moves during high school alone.   Academic courses, extracurricular programs, graduation requirements and transfer of records vary greatly from state to state and even from school to school. These frustrations, in addition to giving up friends and associates, cause anxiety in military children. Separation from a deployed parent (or parents) tends to exacerbate an already difficult situation.    The Military Child Education Coalition is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit , worldwide organization that identifies the challenges facing the highly mobile military child; increases awareness of these challenges in military and educational communities; and initiates and implements programs to overcome them. MCEC''s goal is to level the educational playing field for military children wherever they are located around the world, and to model programs that are beneficial to all highly mobile children.

Although the area has been engulfed by suburban growth, MMOW continues to provide for seniors in under-served communities in northeast Tarrant and south Denton counties of North Central Texas.      Home-delivered meals support frail or elderly individuals who are unable to cook or shop for themselves, but who strive to remain independent and in their own homes.  The meals provide daily nutrition as well as the opportunity for social interaction with the volunteers.     Senior center luncheons provide socialization and support groups that are essential for seniors and a strong support system for active seniors who live independently.  For seniors who have followed their adult children to new communities, the luncheons provide the opportunity to develop friendships that replace the network of friends left behind.  The luncheons also provide the opportunity for seniors who live with their adult children to participate autonomously in activities of their choosing.     Metroport Meals On Wheels provides services to individuals in need regardless of age or financial circumstances.  There are no waiting lists and no red tape.  MMOW's programs nourish active seniors, the elderly, chronically ill and disabled with food for the body, and more importantly, care and compassion for the soul.

Through its Policy Program, SFC publishes reports and works with local, state, regional and national leaders to promote nutrition and health, sustainable growing practices, and better access to food.Upon incorporation in 1993, SFC studied food access in low-income neighborhoods of Austin, Texas. Based on this study, SFC published a report, ""Access Denied,"" which identified an inadequacy of food access and led to a city-sponsored addition of a ""grocery bus"" line to connect neighborhoods with markets.Following the success of a ""Grocery Bus"" for low income neighborhoods in East Austin, SFC moved forward to develop Farmers' markets near WIC clinics and next launced the La Cocina Alegre (Happy Kitchen) cooking school for individuals and families at higher risk for nutrition-related disease. Additionally, through a Youth and Community Gardens Program, SFC operates six demonstration and food production sites, which provide educational and micro-enterprise projects for low-income families and youth.In delivering its programs, SFC partners with more than 35 local organizations to reach people in their own communities, to increase program effectiveness, and to maximize donor investments. SFC's partners include universities, elementary and secondary schools, human service agencies, religious organizations, gardening affiliates, health providers, public agencies and neighborhood organizations.Community and Youth Gardens Program (growing food); a Farmers' Market Program (buying, selling and distributing food and promoting sustainable growing practices) the Happy Kitchen/La Cocina Alegre Program (using and cooking food) and Policy Outreach (improving local food systems).

YMCA of Corpus Christi,jscoville@ymca-cc.org,James Scoville,,Executive Director,http://www.ymca-cc.org,417 S Upper Broadway ,Corpus Christi,78401,,"Founded in 1883, YMCAs collectively make up the largest nonprofit community service organization in America. YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs'' strength is in the people they bring together.In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation''s largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men''s Christian Association.The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn''t until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.

Dr. Glenn Wilkerson, with the support of the University of Texas, performed a study in Houston elementary, middle and high schools. Students at all levels of performance revealed a child''s self-concept is made of 2/3''s self-esteem and 1/3 self worth.   It further revealed a child''s self esteem is fueled by the unconditional love and acceptance given by the adults in their life. Self worth was fueled by what they could achieve. This study resulted in developing a program that didn''t exist until now, the ARK Program. (Adults Relating to Kids)  ARK reaches children through the adults in their lives. It teaches parents, schoolteachers, childcare workers and other caregivers how to relate to children with unconditional love and acceptance. It creates relationships that allow us to deal with all situations, good and bad, by separating the child from the behavior. Loving them for who they are, not what they do. This program helps us raise children into responsible, loving adults giving them hope and confidence in a better tomorrow. This program also benefits adult relationships.

HABITAT FOR HUMANITYThis international program, initiated in 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller, helps end poverty and provide affordable homes for low-income families.  In 1999, CSF partnered with the Habitat chapters in North Texas to provide the air conditioning and heating systems in these homes.  Each year CSF provides equipment and labor for installation of 30 systems in new homes.SHORT-TERM COMMUNITY PROJECTSThese projects are an avenue through which volunteers respond to emerging community needs through non-profit organizations that provide services to people in crisis and rehabilitation programs.  Through funds provided by the CSF, precious dollars can then be used to provide direct services to people in crisis and rehabilitation programs.

"Mentors for Veterans by Veterans, Inc.",jimw@mentorsforveterans.org,James Wright,,President,www.mentorsforveterans.org,PO Box 3205 ,Odessa,79760,,"We are a faith-based nonprofit mentoring organization that is run for Veterans by Veterans! Our objective is to give Veterans, especially those that are disabled, a realistic hope of achieving the meaningful and enriched future that they deserve after they leave the military. We are meeting this objective by using a nationwide array of both Campus and Online programs to assist Veterans in transforming their hopes and dreams into specific workable plans. Since Vietnam, sociologists and psychologists have spent a considerable amount of time evaluating the root causes of problems that Veterans have when they leave the military. Our methods to help these Veterans help themselves are based on the results of their studies.The primary reason that many Veterans have such a difficult time adjusting to civilian life, and for example utilizing the GI Bill for education, after leaving the military is that as new civilians they often feel ""alone and lost."" This is because while in the military they were ""programmed to act as a member of an efficient team that had well-defined missions where their individual responsibilities were very specific."" Their loyalty and obedience were rewarded by the military supplying all of their basic life needs (food, shelter, medical care, etc.) and they knew the other members of their team would not let them down. In fact, the team members often risked their lives for each other. The end result of this military training, or programming, is that the team members became strongly bonded to each other through the team. This type of team is often called an ""emotional support group"" by sociologists and psychologists. We help colleges and universities throughout the America set up ""Veteran self-mentoring"" programs on their campuses where Veterans help each other academically, emotionally and spiritually. This self-mentoring program is actually the basis of forming a ""new emotional support group"" that replaces the strong one that they had while in the military. These on-campus programs are created as ""student activities"" organizations in order to retain the character and personality of each particular campus. We work with the Veteran ""Certifying Official"" on each campus in the forming of this organization in a manner that it will be the basis of this new support group for the Veterans. Our activities include 1) helping find a suitable faculty advisor, 2) helping the faculty advisor set up a ""student activities"" organization, 3) suggesting activities that have worked for Veterans in the past on other campuses, and 4) creating a ""national lessons learned"" report so the organizations on each campus nationwide will improve from semester to semester. The basis of all of our programs is to assist, guide and support the Veterans through the academic or technical training required to meet their individual aspirations. Finally, we help prepare them to successfully participate in a competitive job market. As an integral and fundamental part of this process we persistently point Veterans down the path of good habits, good morals, good health, and good friends to help them continue to develop their new civilian emotional support system to replace the one they left behind in the military. To the best of our knowledge, no other assistive group or organization provides these services for the Veteran.

In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility. Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn't until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.
