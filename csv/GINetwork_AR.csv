Because of logistical problems of transporting these large numbers of youth, we purchased and renovated a 5,500 sq.ft. building to function as a community outreach center for youth and families in the city of Newport (30 miles away).  Volunteers spent eight months and over 2,400 hours renovating the building with the help of community support and other local volunteers.  Over $30,000 was given locally in cash and materials.  The Center is now drawing support from a growing number of local volunteers.  Services have grown to provide emergency food and clothes, a youth activity program, the Faith in Action Coalition (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program to serve the elderly / terminally ill).  With additional funding for ""Project Compassion"" we will launch an after-school program with mentoring, recreation, and homework help; a technology center to serve single mothers, youth,home schoolers, and adult education.  A commercial kitchen is 90% finished to begin a soup kitchen for the poor and homeless of the community.

Aerospace Education America''s love of manned flight started with the Wright brothers and continues unabated during this century. World War II showcased the important role aviation would play in the future and national leaders recognized the importance of stimulating public interest in aerospace activities. CAP, as the civilian Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, was most suited to perform this mission. Their efforts focused on two different audiences - internal CAP members and the general public.Aerospace educators working out of CAP''s National Headquarters at Maxwell AFB, Ala., provide materials that are current and reflect the highest standards of educational excellence.The congressional charter also tasked CAP to stimulate public interest in aerospace issues. These external programs are primarily conducted through our nation''s education systems.  These workshops highlight basic aerospace knowledge and focus on advances in aerospace technology. Textbooks, learning tools, and visual aids geared to stimulate interest in aerospace matters also are provided for teachers to use in their classrooms. Started in 1951, these workshops have reached hundreds of thousands of young people.CAP also plans and executes the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education. NCASE is the premier aerospace education conference held in the nation. The NCASE is designed to promote an understanding of aviation and space education to motivate and encourage teachers to incorporate aerospace education into their curriculum. It also encourages aerospace leaders to speak out on aerospace issues facing our nation today.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

This is the first and greatest commandment.    And the second is like it:    Love your neighbor as yourself.     Mt 22:37 - 39    Jesus also said,          I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.
