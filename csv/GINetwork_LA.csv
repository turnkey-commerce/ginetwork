The United States Teen Summit Foundation established its first outreach super-center located in Baton Rouge, LA in the year 2002; which offers tutoring sessions, adult education classes, a start of the art recording studio for video, sound recording and music production, computer labs and a complete fitness centers for kids of all ages especially at-risk, underprivileged teens and young adults with an abusive or criminal history. The United States Teen Summit Foundation has hosted two successful teen summit events which is a combination of discussion panels brought forward to our teens that will cover topics on Education, Drugs, Alcohol, Sex, Violence, Peer Pressure, Law and Prison etc; and there's also live entertainment, with performances from the hottest artists of today's music. Society has created a major problem for our children; they have already been labeled as Generation Y, crossing them out and throwing them away. But we the producers and sponsors of The United States Teen Summit 2003 want you to know we see our teens as a Powerful Force, Xcellent and Xtra-OrdinaryWhy does the United States Teen Summit Foundation, Inc. want to do this program? The founders of the United States Teen Summit Foundation, Inc. saw a need in their community and city (Baton Rouge, LA) where they grew up to reduce crime and promote continuing education to at risk teens and young adults. Statistics showed the state of Louisiana was dead last as far as education was concerned in the years of 1999 - 2000. On the other hand in the year 2000 Louisiana had 12.5 Murders per 100,000 people, ranking the state as having the highest murder rate than any other state in the United States of America, in which 45% of the murders were committed by teens and young adults ranging from ages 15 - 23 according to the Disaster Center of the United States Uniform Crime Report. The United States Teen Summit Foundation (formally Baton Rouge Teen Summit Foundation) has proved by having this educational program and an outreach centers available for the teens or young adults throughout state of Louisiana, it detours them from committing crimes and violent acts, being that their time is spent doing positive activities. It also helps to provide young people with an opportunity to develop skills in the area of recording, producing, writing music, or developing their skills as singers. It has been proven that the creative energies released through artistic expression have helped to reduce the aggressive energies (that can lead to crime or experimentation with illegal activities and unhealthy behavior) by providing a positive channel for those energies. Community centers throughout the country have seen significant drops in the violent tendencies of teenagers where they have become actively involved in artistic programs.Our overall mission is to guide our future citizens and leaders on the right path of rightness, we want them to make great decisions in their life so they can prosper and reap great rewards of life. We don't want our kids to go astray and end up another derogative statistic; we want them to know that education is an important tool right now in their life and throughout their life. We want the teens and young adults to know someone cares and there's help when they need it. Since the United States Teen Summit Foundation has been in existence we have helped over 14,000 teens in tutoring, establish self esteem and self confidence, anger management and independence. Thirty-five percent of the teens we help have gone on to seek a higher education (college, trade school, technical school etc.) and are now productive citizens in their community.  ""To us, that's success""!

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Many of these boys were brought to us after having been expelled from school or having failed because of these issues. Grace House was developed as a residential program that would house this teen for an extended period of time 1 - 2 years. Through educational and remedial work, through extensive counseling and therapy, and through family counseling, through recreational activities, and through family type dynamics we have been able to redirect these boys. Part of our success has been in educating parents on how to be better parents and how to cope with these issues. Our boys are now on the honor role at school and most have plans to attend college. Our goal is to return the boy to his home after having redirected the boy and changed the home.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

Parents Without Partners was founded in 1957 in New York City by two single parents: Jim Egleson, a non-custodial parent, and Jacqueline Bernard, a custodial parent. As concerned parents, they felt isolated from society because of their marital status, and decided to form a mutual support organization. Following their first newspaper advertisements directed to """"Parents Without Partners"""", 25 single parents attended the first meeting in a Greenwich Village church basement. Later, media attention brought inquiries from all over the country. Parents Without Partners, Inc. is now the largest international, nonprofit membership organization devoted to the welfare and interests of single parents and their children. Single parents may be male or female, custodial or non-custodial, separated, divorced, widowed or never-married.

YMCA of NE LA,galyeanj@aol.com,Jeff Galyean,,Executive Director,WWW.YNELA.ORG,1505 Stubbs Avenue ,Monroe,71201,,"Founded in 1883, YMCAs collectively make up the largest nonprofit community service organization in America. YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay. YMCAs' strength is in the people they bring together.In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.YMCA programs are tools for building the values of caring, honesty, respect and responsibility.  Longtime leaders in community-based health and fitness and aquatics, Ys teach kids to swim, offer exercise classes for people with disabilities and lead adult aerobics. They also offer hundreds of other programs in response to community needs, including camping, child care (the Y movement is the nation's largest not-for-profit provider), teen clubs, environmental programs, substance abuse prevention, youth sports, family nights, job training, international exchange and many more.Organization: Each YMCA is a charitable nonprofit, qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each is independent. YMCAs are required by the national constitution to pay annual dues, to refrain from discrimination and to support the YMCA mission. All other decisions are local choices, including programs offered, staffing and style of operation. The national office, called the YMCA of the USA, is in Chicago, with Field offices in California, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Texas. It is staffed by 241 employees. Its purpose is to serve member associations.International: YMCAs are at work in more than 120 countries around the world, serving more than 30 million people. Some 230 local US Ys maintain more than 370 relationships with Ys in other countries, operate international programs and contribute to YMCA work worldwide through the YMCA World Service campaign. Like other national YMCA movements, the YMCA of the USA is a member of the World Alliance of YMCAs, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.History: The YMCA was founded in London, England, in 1844 by George Williams and about a dozen friends who lived and worked as clerks in a drapery a forerunner of dry-goods and department stores. Their goal was to help young men like themselves find God. The first members were evangelical Protestants who prayed and studied the Bible as an alternative to vice. The Y movement has always been nonsectarian and today accepts those of all faiths at all levels of the organization, despite its unchanging name, the Young Men's Christian Association.The first U.S. YMCA started in Boston in 1851, the work of Thomas Sullivan, a retired sea captain who was a lay missionary. Ys spread fast and soon were serving boys and older men as well as young men. Although 5,145 women worked in YMCA military canteens in World War I, it wasn't until after World War II that women and girls were admitted to full membership and participation in the US YMCAs. Today half of all YMCA members and program members are female, and half are under age 18.

YMCAs are at the heart of community life in neighborhoods and towns across the nation. They work to meet the health and social service needs of 16.9 million men, women and children.  Ys help people develop values and behavior that are consistent with Christian principles. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages and incomes.

In the average Y, a volunteer board sets policy for its executive, who manages the operation with full-time and part-time staff and volunteer leaders. Ys meet local community needs through organized activities called programs. In its own way, every Y nurtures the healthy development of children and teens; strengthens families; and makes its community a healthier, safer, better place to live.
